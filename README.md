WHY

In a new paradigm of crypto economics, the most important and critical function is the ability to store and exchange our digital assets in a secure manner. Centralized exchanges have been proven to be unreliable and insecure, often hacked or abused. We believe that in order to advance the mass adoption of crypto, a new architecture must be introduced to enable secure and direct peer-to-peer value exchange. The true philosophy of blockchain, is to eliminate the need of middleman and to enable transactions without having to place trust in 3-rd parties.

HOW

We will introduce a truly decentralized exchange platform and proof-of- stake blockchain network with cross-chain atomic-swap capabilities to facilitate the direct transacting of value between network users. There will be no fees for the direct peer-to-peer exchanges, as these transactions are performed directly between user wallets. The TWINS cryptocurrency will be used to power the exchange platform for buy and sell order listings and to reward the community-supported and decentralized hosting of network nodes.
